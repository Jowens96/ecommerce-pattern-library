  <h2>The European Griffin</h2>

  <p>Most statuary representations of griffins depict them with bird-like talons, although in some older illustrations griffins have a lion's forelimbs; they generally have a lion's hindquarters. Its eagle's head is conventionally given prominent ears; these are sometimes described as the lion's ears, but are often elongated (more like a horse's), and are sometimes feathered. Infrequently, a griffin is portrayed without wings, or a wingless eagle-headed lion is identified as a griffin. In 15th-century and later heraldry, such a beast may be called an alce or a keythong.</p>

  <h3>Care</h3>
  <p>Your Griffin’s cage should remind him of his natural environment. This means that the bigger the cage, the better. For sleeping, your Griffin may like to rest in a fleece-lined hut that hangs at the top of his cage. On the bottom of the cage, you’ll want to put down corn cob bedding, aspen wood pellets, recycled paper or cage liners. Bedding should be spot cleaned weekly and completely changed every month. Place the cage at or below eye level away from drafty windows and doors. Griffins are also sensitive of odours so keep their home out of the kitchen.</p>
